# Big data management (Hadoop/Pig)

## Introduction

This project is part of a Master's degree in Data Science, focusing on the analysis of Olympic Games data. 
The data is sourced from [www.sports-reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com) 

## Implementation Details

- **Environment**: The project is implemented using Pig, a high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs on Hadoop.
- **System**: Development and execution are performed on a Linux-based system.

## Hadoop Installation

For this project, Hadoop is installed in Single-Node Local (Standalone) Mode. 
This mode is recommended for debugging and simplifies the installation process, making it ideal for development on a personal machine rather than a cluster.

### Installation Guide

1. **Version Selection**: Choose a Hadoop version compatible with your system's specifications. The latest version is not always necessary.
2. **Installation Instructions**: Follow the detailed installation steps on the [official Hadoop website](https://hadoop.apache.org/), tailored to your machine's setup.

## Data Source

The project utilizes Olympic Games data from [www.sports-reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com). Ensure you have access to this data through the provided website or the course's eClass platform.

## Getting Started

1. Install Pig and Hadoop as described, focusing on compatibility with your system.
2. Access and familiarize yourself with the Olympic Games data structure and contents.
