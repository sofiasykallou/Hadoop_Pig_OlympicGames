To load csv and make ETL:
	
#load csv loader and load file

DEFINE CsvLoader org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVLoader();
athlete_data = LOAD '/home/Documents/athlete_events.csv' USING CsvLoader() AS (ID:chararray, Name:chararray, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Height:double, Weight:double, Team:chararray, NOC:chararray, Games:chararray, Year:int, Season:chararray, City:chararray, Sport:chararray, Event:chararray, Medal:chararray);
